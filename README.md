# Analysis of Adult Census Income Dataset - Manual
The following project contains code for data analyzing and generating ML models on Adult Census Income Dataset  
The project requires some pre-requisites for working:
- Windows Platform
- Python 3.12.5
- VSCode or Jupyter IDE

## Project Directory
The following project directory contains following files:
- **adult_census_income.ipynb** - Jupyter file that contains solution code for doing Data Analysis and generating Machine Learning model
- **adult-census-income.csv** - CSV file for the dataset being used for analysis
- **README.md** - Description file for the whole project

## Setting up of Virtual Environment
After downloading the zip file, the following steps are to be followed for creating a virtual environment for the project:
1. In your terminal, move to the project directory using `cd` command
2. Run the command to create a python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Run the command to activate the virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Installing the required dependencies
The following project requires some libraries to be installed. Following command needs to be run
for smooth operations of the project: `pip install requests pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy imbalanced-learn`

## Running the code
There is jupyter file: `adult_census_income.ipynb` within the directory which contains all the code. The file consists of code with appropriate markdown for distinguishing various sections. Each segment of code can be executed in order to finally achieve the results for completing the data analysis and generating a Machine Learning model for the chosen dataset.
